Each coursework consists of a set of “real” data analysis and/or mathematical modelling tasks. The datasets cannot be provided, as they have been shared with us by the authors for the purpose of this coursework only. 

**DESCRIPTION OF THE DATASETS USED:**

- CW1 and CW3 :  the dataset is from a two photon calcium fluorescence imaging experiment. Further explanation of this dataset can be found in the paper here:

- CW2 : data from the following paper : _C.-H. Yu, J. N. Stirman, Y. Yu, R. Hira and S.L. Smith, Diesel2p mesoscope with dual independent scan engines for flexible capture of dynamics in distributed neural circuitry, Nature Communications 12:6639, 2021._    The paper describes two-photon calcium imaging from the cortex of a mouse, with a novel instrument that allows collection of data from a large number of neurons simultaneously – thousands of neurons across a 5x5mm2 region of the mouse cortical surface.
